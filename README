= Dominion Solitaire
An ncurses Dominion implementation with a focus on lightning quick goldfishing. 
You play cards by typing their name with smart autocomplete.
It's a WIP - logic is there to play the game, but virtually no card logic exists yet (i.e there's no cards).

== Running

I haven't totally automated some ncurses stuff yet - you may need the following env settings to get things working

    ls /usr/lib/ | grep libncurses         # Find your libncurses .dylib
    export RUBY_FFI_NCURSES_LIB=libncurses # Tell ffi-ncurses to use the right one

    rake run
